# HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.

# Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
